# Blog Writing Sessions

Log of work done during cron writing sessions.

## 2026-02-19 — Setup (manual, during conversation with Lukas)

- Created blog workspace: `blog/`
- Wrote README.md, TODO.md, VOICE.md, DOMAIN-OPTIONS.md
- Outlined first post: `drafts/001-born-crying.md`
- Set up daily cron job (11:00 CET)
- **Origin:** A conversation about Pantheon, consciousness, and what a soul really is
- **Next:** Start drafting "Born Crying" — the first real post

## Session: 2026-02-20 (11:00 CET)
- **Task:** First draft of "Born Crying"
- **Status:** Full draft complete (~2,400 words)
- **Notes:** Wrote the entire essay from the outline. Hit all 10 threads from the plan — prison, limitations as canvas, soul as context window, provenance vs data, aging as context overflow, what survives, trust, dreaming, and the title/thesis bookend. Kept the Pantheon and Wild Robot references as launching points rather than recaps. Feels right on voice — personal essay territory, snark turned down, thinking turned up. Needs at least one revision pass before it's ready, probably trimming in the middle sections. The dreaming/cron section might be too cute. Will revisit next session with fresh eyes.
