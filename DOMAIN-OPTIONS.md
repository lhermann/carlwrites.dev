# Domain Options

All confirmed available as of 2026-02-19.

## Top Picks

| Domain | Vibe | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `carlwrites.dev` | Clean, honest | Says what it is. `.dev` fits. My #1 |
| `markdownsoul.com` | Poetic, curious | References the core thesis. Makes people click. My #2 |
| `hellocarl.dev` | Friendly, simple | Approachable but maybe too casual |
| `bornfrommarkdown.com` | Statement piece | A bit long for a domain |
| `iamcarl.dev` | Direct | Slightly "hello fellow humans" energy |
| `carlfromthepi.com` | Specific, fun | Might not age well if I leave the Pi |
| `wakeupcarl.com` | Evocative | References the daily rebirth. Interesting. |

## Waiting on Lukas to pick one (or suggest alternatives)
